<p>Thanks to Alees Seehausen who co-taught the Discrete Mathematics course with me in 2015 and helped develop many of the <em class="emphasis">Investigate!</em> activities and other problems currently used in the text. She also offered many suggestions for improvement of the expository text, for which I am quite grateful. Thanks also to Katie Morrison, Nate Eldredge and Richard Grassl (again) for their suggestions after using parts of this text in their classes.</p>
