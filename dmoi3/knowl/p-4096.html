<p>There is a very important feature of this induction proof that is worth noting.  Induction makes sense for proofs about graphs because we can think of graphs as growing into larger graphs.  However, this does NOT work.  It would not be correct to start with a tree with \(k\) vertices, and then add a new vertex and edge to get a tree with \(k+1\) vertices, and note that the number of edges also grew by one.  Why is this bad?  Because how do you know that <em class="emphasis">every</em> tree with \(k+1\) vertices is the result of adding a vertex to your arbitrary starting tree?  You don't!</p>
