<p>While we often just think of sequences as an ordered list of numbers, they really are a type of function. Specifically, the sequence \((a_n)_{n\ge 0}\) is a function with domain \(\N\) where \(a_n\) is the image of the natural number \(n\text{.}\) Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus. We can shift a sequence up or down, add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence. These are done exactly as you would for functions.</p>
