<p>Now for the inductive case, fix \(k \ge 1\) and assume that all trees with \(v=k\) vertices have exactly \(e=k-1\) edges.  Now consider an arbitrary tree \(T\) with \(v = k+1\) vertices.  By <a knowl="./knowl/prop-leaves-in-trees.html" title="Proposition 4.2.3">PropositionÂ 4.2.3</a>, \(T\) has a vertex \(v_0\) of degree one.  Let \(T'\) be the tree resulting from removing \(v_0\) from \(T\) (together with its incident edge).  Since we removed a leaf, \(T'\) is still a tree (the unique paths between pairs of vertices in \(T'\) are the same as the unique paths between them in \(T\)).</p>
