<p>Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square. While this happens often, it does not always happen. For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{,}\) then the triangle with sides \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) is a <em class="emphasis">right</em> triangle. Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.</p>
