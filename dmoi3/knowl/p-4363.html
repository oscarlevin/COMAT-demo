<p>If we start at a vertex and trace along edges to get to other vertices, we create a <em class="emphasis">walk</em> through the graph. More precisely, a <dfn class="terminology">walk</dfn> in a graph is a sequence of vertices such that every vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertices before and after it in the sequence. If the walk travels along every edge exactly once, then the walk is called an <dfn class="terminology">Euler path</dfn> (or <dfn class="terminology">Euler walk</dfn>). If, in addition, the starting and ending vertices are the same (so you trace along every edge exactly once and end up where you started), then the walk is called an <dfn class="terminology">Euler circuit</dfn> (or <dfn class="terminology">Euler tour</dfn>). Of course if a graph is not connected, there is no hope of finding such a path or circuit. For the rest of this section, assume all the graphs discussed are connected.</p>
