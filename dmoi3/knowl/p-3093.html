<p>However, the characteristic root technique is only useful for solving recurrence relations in a particular form: \(a_n\) is given as a linear combination of some number of previous terms.  These recurrence relations are called <dfn class="terminology">linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients</dfn>.  The “homogeneous” refers to the fact that there is no additional term in the recurrence relation other than a multiple of \(a_j\) terms.  For example, \(a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 1\) is <em class="emphasis">non-homogeneous</em> because of the additional constant 1.  There are general methods of solving such things, but we will not consider them here, other than through the use of telescoping or iteration described above.</p>
