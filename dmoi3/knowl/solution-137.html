<p>Note that it doesn't make sense to ask for the number of <em class="emphasis">bijections</em> here, as there are none (because the codomain is larger than the domain, there are no surjections). But for a function to be injective, we just can't use an element of the codomain more than once.</p>
<p>We need to pick an element from the codomain to be the image of 1. There are 8 choices. Then we need to pick one of the remaining 7 elements to be the image of 2. Finally, one of the remaining 6 elements must be the image of 3. So the total number of functions is \(8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 = P(8,3)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>What this demonstrates in general is that the number of injections \(f:A \to B\text{,}\) where \(\card{A} = k\) and \(\card{B} = n\text{,}\) is \(P(n,k)\text{.}\)</p>
