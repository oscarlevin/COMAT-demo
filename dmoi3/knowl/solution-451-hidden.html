<p>Doing this directly would be difficult, but we can use the matching condition to help. Construct a graph \(G\) with 13 vertices in the set \(A\text{,}\) each representing one of the 13 card values, and 13 vertices in the set \(B\text{,}\) each representing one of the 13 piles. Draw an edge between a vertex \(a \in A\) to a vertex \(b \in B\) if a card with value \(a\) is in the pile \(b\text{.}\) Notice that we are just looking for a matching of \(A\text{;}\) each value needs to be found in the piles exactly once.</p>
<p>We will have a matching if the matching condition holds. Given any set of card values (a set \(S \subseteq A\)) we must show that \(|N(S)| \ge |S|\text{.}\) That is, the number of piles that contain those values is at least the number of different values. But what if it wasn't? Say \(|S| = k\text{.}\) If \(|N(S)| \lt k\text{,}\) then we would have fewer than \(4k\) different cards in those piles (since each pile contains 4 cards). But there are \(4k\) cards with the \(k\) different values, so at least one of these cards must be in another pile, a contradiction. Thus the matching condition holds, so there is a matching, as required.</p>
