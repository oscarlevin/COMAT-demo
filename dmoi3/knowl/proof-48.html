<p>Again, we proceed by contradiction. Suppose \(K_{3,3}\) were planar. Then by Euler's formula there will be 5 faces, since \(v = 6\text{,}\) \(e = 9\text{,}\) and \(6 - 9 + f = 2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>How many boundaries surround these 5 faces? Let \(B\) be this number. Since each edge is used as a boundary twice, we have \(B = 2e\text{.}\) Also, \(B \ge 4f\) since each face is surrounded by 4 or more boundaries. We know this is true because \(K_{3,3}\) is bipartite, so does not contain any 3-edge cycles. Thus</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
4f \le 2e\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But this would say that \(20 \le 18\text{,}\) which is clearly false. Thus \(K_{3,3}\) is not planar.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_planar.html#HvM">in-context</a></span>
