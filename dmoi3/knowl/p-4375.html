<p>Suppose you wanted to tour KÃ¶nigsberg in such a way where you visit each land mass (the two islands and both banks) exactly once. This can be done. In graph theory terms, we are asking whether there is a path which visits every vertex exactly once. Such a path is called a <dfn class="terminology">Hamilton path</dfn> (or <dfn class="terminology">Hamiltonian path</dfn>).  We could also consider <dfn class="terminology">Hamilton cycles</dfn>, which are Hamliton paths which start and stop at the same vertex.</p>
