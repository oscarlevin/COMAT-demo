<p>Note that for us, <em class="emphasis">or</em> is the <dfn class="terminology">inclusive or</dfn>  (and not the sometimes used <em class="emphasis">exclusive or</em>) meaning that \(P \vee Q\) is in fact true when both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true. As for the other connectives, “and” behaves as you would expect, as does negation. The biconditional (if and only if) might seem a little strange, but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements are <em class="emphasis">equivalent</em> in that they have the same truth value. This leaves only the conditional \(P \imp Q\) which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics than it does in ordinary usage. However, implications are so common and useful in mathematics, that we must develop fluency with their use, and as such, they deserve their own subsection.</p>
