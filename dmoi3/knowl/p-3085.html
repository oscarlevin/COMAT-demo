<p>Perhaps the most famous recurrence relation is \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\text{,}\) which together with the initial conditions \(F_0 = 0\) and \(F_1= 1\) defines the Fibonacci sequence.  But notice that this is precisely the type of recurrence relation on which we can use the characteristic root technique. When you do, the only thing that changes is that the characteristic equation does not factor, so you need to use the quadratic formula to find the characteristic roots. In fact, doing so gives the third most famous irrational number, \(\varphi\text{,}\) the <dfn class="terminology">golden ratio</dfn>.</p>
