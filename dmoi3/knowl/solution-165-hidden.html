<p>Why is this true? \({n \choose k}\) counts the number of ways to select \(k\) things from \(n\) choices. On the other hand, \({n \choose n-k}\) counts the number of ways to select \(n-k\) things from \(n\) choices. Are these really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the \(n-k\) things you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose \(n-k\) things to exclude from \(n\) choices. Clearly this is \({n \choose n-k}\) as well (it doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the things once you have chosen them). And if you exclude \(n-k\) things, then you are including the other \(k\) things. So the set of outcomes should be the same.</p>
<p>Let's try the pizza counting example like we did above. How many ways are there to pick \(k\) toppings from a list of \(n\) choices? On the one hand, the answer is simply \({n \choose k}\text{.}\) Alternatively, you could make a list of all the toppings you don't want. To end up with a pizza containing exactly \(k\) toppings, you need to pick \(n-k\) toppings to not put on the pizza. You have \({n \choose n-k}\) choices for the toppings you don't want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with \(k\) toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with \(k\) toppings. Thus these two answers must be the same: \({n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>You can also prove (explain) this identity using bit strings, subsets, or lattice paths. The bit string argument is nice: \({n \choose k}\) counts the number of bit strings of length \(n\) with \(k\) 1's. This is also the number of bit string of length \(n\) with \(k\) 0's (just replace each 1 with a 0 and each 0 with a 1). But if a string of length \(n\) has \(k\) 0's, it must have \(n-k\) 1's. And there are exactly \({n\choose n-k}\) strings of length \(n\) with \(n-k\) 1's.</p>
