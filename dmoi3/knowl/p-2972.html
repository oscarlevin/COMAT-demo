<p>Not a huge surprise: one way to count the number of squares in a \(4 \times 4\) chessboard is to notice that there are \(16\) squares with side length 1, 9 with side length 2, 4 with side length 3 and 1 with side length 4. So the original sequence is just the sum of squares. Now this sequence of differences is not arithmetic since it's sequence of differences (the differences of the differences of the original sequence) is not constant. In fact, this sequence of <dfn class="terminology">second differences</dfn> is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
5, 7, 9, \ldots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which <em class="emphasis">is</em> an arithmetic sequence (with constant difference 2). Notice that our original sequence had <dfn class="terminology">third differences</dfn> (that is, differences of differences of differences of the original) constant. We will call such a sequence \(\Delta^3\)-constant. The sequence \(1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots\) has second differences constant, so it will be a \(\Delta^2\)-constant sequence. In general, we will say a sequence is a <dfn class="terminology">\(\Delta^k\)-constant</dfn>   sequence if the \(k\)th differences are constant.</p>
