<article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h6>
<p>The proof is by contradiction. So assume that \(K_5\) is planar. Then the graph must satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. \(K_5\) has 5 vertices and 10 edges, so we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
5 - 10 + f = 2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which says that if the graph is drawn without any edges crossing, there would be \(f = 7\) faces.</p>
<p>Now consider how many edges surround each face. Each face must be surrounded by at least 3 edges. Let \(B\) be the total number of <em class="emphasis">boundaries</em> around all the faces in the graph. Thus we have that \(B \ge 3f\text{.}\) But also \(B = 2e\text{,}\) since each edge is used as a boundary exactly twice. Putting this together we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
3f \le 2e
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But this is impossible, since we have already determined that \(f = 7\) and \(e = 10\text{,}\) and \(21 \not\le 20\text{.}\) This is a contradiction so in fact \(K_5\) is not planar.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_planar.html#boD">in-context</a></span>
