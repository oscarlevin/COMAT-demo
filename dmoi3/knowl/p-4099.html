<p> As soon as one vertex of a tree is designated as the <dfn class="terminology">root</dfn>, then every other vertex on the tree can be characterized by its position relative to the root.  This works because between any two vertices in a tree, there is a unique path.  So from any vertex, we can travel back to the root in exactly one way.  This also allows us to describe how distinct vertices in a rooted tree are related.</p>
