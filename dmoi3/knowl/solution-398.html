<p>It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about \(n\text{.}\) We might be able to prove that \(n^3 - n\) is even if we knew that \(n\) was even. In fact, we could probably prove that \(n^3-n\) was even if \(n\) was odd. But since \(n\) must either be even or odd, this will be enough. Here's the proof.</p>
<article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h6>
<p>We consider two cases: if \(n\) is even or if \(n\) is odd.</p>
<p>Case 1: \(n\) is even. Then \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\text{.}\) This give</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = 8k^3 - 2k\\
\amp = 2(4k^2 - k)\text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>and since \(4k^2 - k\) is an integer, this says that \(n^3-n\) is even.</p>
<p>Case 2: \(n\) is odd. Then \(n = 2k+1\) for some integer \(k\text{.}\) This gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)\\
\amp = 8k^3 + 6k^2 + 6k + 1 - 2k - 1\\
\amp = 2(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k)\text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>and since \(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is even again.</p>
<p>Since \(n^3 - n\) is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is indeed always even.</p></article>
