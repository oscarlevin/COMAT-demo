<p>We are going to try to <em class="emphasis">solve</em> these recurrence relations. By this we mean something very similar to solving differential equations: we want to find a function of \(n\) (a closed formula) which satisfies the recurrence relation, as well as the initial condition.<a knowl="./knowl/fn-9-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> Just like for differential equations, finding a solution might be tricky, but checking that the solution is correct is easy.</p>
