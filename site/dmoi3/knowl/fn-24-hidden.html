<body><span class="footnote">The standard example for matchings used to be the <em class="emphasis">marriage problem</em> in which \(A\) consisted of the men in the town, \(B\) the women, and an edge represented a marriage that was agreeable to both parties. A matching then represented a way for the town elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed. We have chosen a more progressive context for the sake of political correctness.</span></body>
