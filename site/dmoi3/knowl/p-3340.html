<p>Throughout the chapter we tried to understand <em class="emphasis">why</em> these facts listed above are true. In part, that is what proofs, by induction or not, attempt to accomplish: they explain why mathematical truths are in fact truths. As we develop our ability to reason about mathematics, it is a good idea to make sure that the methods of our reasoning are sound. The branch of mathematics that deals with deciding whether reasoning is good or not is <em class="emphasis">mathematical logic</em>, the subject of the next chapter.</p>
