<p>First we should consider if this even makes sense.  Given any connected graph \(G\text{,}\) will there always be a subgraph that is a tree?  Well, that is actually too easy: you could just take a single edge of \(G\text{.}\)  If we want to use this subgraph to tell us how to visit all vertices, then we want our subgraph to include all of the vertices.  We call such a tree a <dfn class="terminology">spanning tree</dfn>.  It turns out that every connected graph has one (and usually many).</p>
