<p>The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we could also ask about coloring edges. Just like with vertex coloring, we might insist that edges that are adjacent must be colored differently. Here, we are thinking of two edges as being adjacent if they are incident to the same vertex. The least number of colors required to properly color the edges of a graph \(G\) is called the <dfn class="terminology">chromatic index</dfn>  of \(G\text{,}\) written \(\chi'(G)\)  .</p>
