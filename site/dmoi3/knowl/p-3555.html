<p>Geoff Poshingten is out at a fancy pizza joint, and decides to order a calzone. When the waiter asks what he would like in it, he replies, “I want either pepperoni or sausage. Also, if I have sausage, then I must also include quail. Oh, and if I have pepperoni or quail then I must also have ricotta cheese.”</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Translate Geoff's order into logical symbols.</p></li>
<li><p>The waiter knows that Geoff is either a liar or a truth-teller (so either everything he says is false, or everything is true). Which is it?</p></li>
<li><p>What, if anything, can the waiter conclude about the ingredients in Geoff's desired calzone?</p></li>
