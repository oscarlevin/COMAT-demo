<li><p>Suppose there are only finitely many primes. <em class="emphasis">[this is a premise. Note the use of “suppose.”]</em></p></li>
<li><p>There must be a largest prime, call it \(p\text{.}\) <em class="emphasis">[follows from line 1, by the definition of “finitely many.”]</em></p></li>
<li><p>Let \(N = p! + 1\text{.}\) <em class="emphasis">[basically just notation, although this is the inspired part of the proof; looking at \(p! + 1\) is the key insight.]</em></p></li>
<li>\(N\) is larger than \(p\text{.}\) <em class="emphasis">[by the definition of \(p!\)]</em>
</li>
<li>\(N\) is not divisible by any number less than or equal to \(p\text{.}\) <em class="emphasis">[by definition, \(p!\) is divisible by each number less than or equal to \(p\text{,}\) so \(p! + 1\) is not.]</em>
</li>
<li><p>The prime factorization of \(N\) contains prime numbers greater than \(p\text{.}\) <em class="emphasis">[since \(N\) is divisible by each prime number in the prime factorization of \(N\text{,}\) and by line 5.]</em></p></li>
<li><p>Therefore \(p\) is not the largest prime. <em class="emphasis">[by line 6, \(N\) is divisible by a prime larger than \(p\text{.}\)]</em></p></li>
<li><p>This is a contradiction. <em class="emphasis">[from line 2 and line 7: the largest prime is \(p\) and there is a prime larger than \(p\text{.}\)]</em></p></li>
<li><p>Therefore there are infinitely many primes. <em class="emphasis">[from line 1 and line 8: our only premise lead to a contradiction, so the premise is false.]</em></p></li>
