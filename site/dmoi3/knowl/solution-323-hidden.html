<p>To get a feel for the recurrence relation, write out the first few terms of the sequence: \(4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19, \ldots\text{.}\) Look at the difference between terms. \(a_1 - a_0 = 1\) and \(a_2 - a_1 = 2\) and so on. The key thing here is that the difference between terms is \(n\text{.}\) We can write this explicitly: \(a_n - a_{n-1} = n\text{.}\) Of course, we could have arrived at this conclusion directly from the recurrence relation by subtracting \(a_{n-1}\) from both sides.</p>
<p>Now use this equation over and over again, changing \(n\) each time:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
a_1 - a_0 \amp = 1\\
a_2 - a_1 \amp = 2\\
a_3 - a_2 \amp = 3\\
\vdots \quad \amp \quad \vdots\\
a_n - a_{n-1} \amp = n\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Add all these equations together. On the right-hand side, we get the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n\text{.}\) We already know this can be simplified to \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\text{.}\) What happens on the left-hand side? We get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \cdots (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2})+ (a_n - a_{n-1})\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This sum telescopes. We are left with only the \(-a_0\) from the first equation and the \(a_n\) from the last equation. Putting this all together we have \(-a_0 + a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) or \(a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + a_0\text{.}\) But we know that \(a_0 = 4\text{.}\) So the solution to the recurrence relation, subject to the initial condition is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 4\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>(Now that we know that, we should notice that the sequence is the result of adding 4 to each of the triangular numbers.)</p>
