<p>  In contrast, we could also have partitioned the tree in a different order.  Start with the root, put it in \(A\text{.}\)  Then look for one child of the root to put in \(B\text{.}\)  Then find a child of that vertex, into \(A\text{,}\) and then find its child, into \(B\text{,}\) and so on.  When you get to a vertex with no children, retreat to its parent and see if the parent has any other children.  So we travel as far from the root as fast as possible, then backtrack until we can move forward again.  This is called <dfn class="terminology">depth first search</dfn>.</p>
