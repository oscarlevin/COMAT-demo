<p>Recall, you own 3 regular ties and 5 bow ties.  You realize that it would be okay to wear more than two ties to your clown college interview.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>You must select some of your ties to wear. Everything is okay, from no ties up to all ties. How many choices do you have?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to wear at least one regular tie and one bow tie, but are willing to wear up to all your ties, how many choices do you have for which ties to wear?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many choices of which ties to wear do you have if you wear exactly 2 of the 3 regular ties and 3 of the 5 bow ties?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have selected 2 regular and 3 bow ties, in how many orders could you put the ties on, assuming you must have one of the three bow ties on top?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
