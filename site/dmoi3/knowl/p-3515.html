<p>This is just the truth table for \(P \imp Q\text{,}\) but what matters here is that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table. Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true. The premises in this case are \(P \imp Q\) and \(P\text{.}\) Which <em class="emphasis">rows</em> of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? \(P\) is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row has \(P \imp Q\) true as well. And lo-and-behold, in this one case, \(Q\) is also true. So if \(P\imp Q\) and \(P\) are both true, we see that \(Q\) must be true as well.</p>
