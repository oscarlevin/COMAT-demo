<p>Another difference between this text and most other discrete math books is that this book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem oriented or inquiry based methods. When I teach the class, I will assign sections for reading <em class="emphasis">after</em> first introducing them in class by using a mix of group work and class discussion on a few interesting problems. The text is meant to consolidate what we <em class="emphasis">discover</em> in class and serve as a reference for students as they master the concepts and techniques covered in the unit. None-the-less, every attempt has been made to make the text sufficient for self study as well, in a way that hopefully mimics an inquiry based classroom.</p>
