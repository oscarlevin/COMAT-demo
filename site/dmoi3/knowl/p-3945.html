<p>Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called <dfn class="terminology">complete</dfn>.  That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give these a special name: \(K_n\)  is the complete graph on \(n\) vertices.</p>
