<li>\(f\) is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range. For example, no \(n \in \Z\) gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that \(\frac{1}{3}\) would be sent to 1, but \(\frac{1}{3}\) is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function is \(3\Z\) (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to \(\Z\text{.}\)</li>
<li>\(g\) is not surjective. There is no \(x \in \{1,2,3\}\) (the domain) for which \(g(x) = b\text{,}\) so \(b\text{,}\) which is in the codomain, is not in the range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain “missing” from the bottom row of the matrix.</li>
<li>\(h\) is surjective. Every element of the codomain is also in the range. Nothing in the codomain is missed.</li>
