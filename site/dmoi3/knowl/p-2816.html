<p>Notice that the differences between terms form an arithmetic sequence: \(2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\ldots\text{.}\) This says that the \(n\)th term of the sequence \(1,3,6,10,15,\ldots\) is the <em class="emphasis">sum</em> of the first \(n\) terms in the sequence \(1,2,3,4,5,\ldots\text{.}\) We say that the first sequence is the <dfn class="terminology">sequence of partial sums</dfn>  of the second sequence (partial sums because we are not taking the sum of all infinitely many terms). If we know how to add up the terms of an arithmetic sequence, we could use this to find a closed formula for a sequence whose differences are the terms of that arithmetic sequence.</p>
