<p>Why is this true? \({n \choose k}\) counts the number of ways to select \(k\) things from \(n\) choices. On the other hand, \({n \choose n-k}\) counts the number of ways to select \(n-k\) things from \(n\) choices. Are these really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the \(n-k\) things you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose \(n-k\) things to exclude from \(n\) choices. Clearly this is \({n \choose n-k}\) as well (it doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the things once you have chosen them). And if you exclude \(n-k\) things, then you are including the other \(k\) things. So the set of outcomes should be the same.</p>
