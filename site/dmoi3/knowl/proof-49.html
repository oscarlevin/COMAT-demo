<p>Recall that a regular polyhedron has all of its faces identical regular polygons, and that each vertex has the same degree. Consider the cases, broken up by what the regular polygon might be.</p>
<p>Case 1: Each face is a triangle. Let \(f\) be the number of faces. There are then \(3f/2\) edges. Using Euler's formula we have \(v - 3f/2 + f = 2\) so \(v = 2 + f/2\text{.}\) Now each vertex has the same degree, say \(k\text{.}\) So the number of edges is also \(kv/2\text{.}\) Putting this together gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e = \frac{3f}{2} = \frac{k(2+f/2)}{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which says</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{6f}{4+f}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We need \(k\) and \(f\) to both be positive integers. Note that \(\frac{6f}{4+f}\) is an increasing function for positive \(f\text{,}\) and has a horizontal asymptote at 6. Thus the only possible values for \(k\) are 3, 4, and 5. Each of these are possible. To get \(k = 3\text{,}\) we need \(f = 4\) (this is the tetrahedron).  For \(k = 4\) we take \(f = 8\) (the octahedron).  For \(k = 5\) take \(f = 20\) (the icosahedron).  Thus there are exactly three regular polyhedra with triangles for faces.</p>
<p>Case 2: Each face is a square. Now we have \(e = 4f/2 = 2f\text{.}\) Using Euler's formula we get \(v = 2 + f\text{,}\) and counting edges using the degree \(k\) of each vertex gives us</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e = 2f = \frac{k(2+f)}{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solving for \(k\) gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{4f}{2+f} = \frac{8f}{4+2f}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This is again an increasing function, but this time the horizontal asymptote is at \(k = 4\text{,}\) so the only possible value that \(k\) could take is 3. This produces 6 faces, and we have a cube. There is only one regular polyhedron with square faces.</p>
<p>Case 3: Each face is a pentagon. We perform the same calculation as above, this time getting \(e = 5f/2\) so \(v = 2 + 3f/2\text{.}\) Then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e = \frac{5f}{2} = \frac{k(2+3f/2)}{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{10f}{4+3f}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now the horizontal asymptote is at \(\frac{10}{3}\text{.}\) This is less than 4, so we can only hope of making \(k = 3\text{.}\) We can do so by using 12 pentagons, getting the dodecahedron.  This is the only regular polyhedron with pentagons as faces.</p>
<p>Case 4: Each face is an \(n\)-gon with \(n \ge 6\text{.}\) Following the same procedure as above, we deduce that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{2nf}{4+(n-2)f}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which will be increasing to a horizontal asymptote of \(\frac{2n}{n-2}\text{.}\) When \(n = 6\text{,}\) this asymptote is at \(k = 3\text{.}\) Any larger value of \(n\) will give an even smaller asymptote. Therefore no regular polyhedra exist with faces larger than pentagons.<a knowl="./knowl/fn-21-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_planar.html#nCV">in-context</a></span>
