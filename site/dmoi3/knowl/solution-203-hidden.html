<p>By now it should be no surprise that there are \(8^5\) words, and \(P(8,5)\) words without repeated letters. The new piece here is that we are actually counting functions. For the first problem, we are counting all functions from \(\{1,2,\ldots, 5\}\) to \(\{a,b,\ldots, h\}\text{.}\) The numbers in the domain represent the <em class="emphasis">position</em> of the letter in the word, the codomain represents the letter that could be assigned to that position. If we ask for no repeated letters, we are asking for injective functions.</p>
<p>If \(A\) and \(B\) are <em class="emphasis">any</em> sets with \(|A| = 5\) and \(|B| = 8\text{,}\) then the number of functions \(f: A \to B\) is \(8^5\) and the number of injections is \(P(8,5)\text{.}\) So if you can represent your counting problem as a function counting problem, most of the work is done.</p>
