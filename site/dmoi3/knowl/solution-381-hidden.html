<p>These statements are NOT logically equivalent. To see this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate \(P(x,y)\) which makes one of the statements true and the other false.</p>
<p>Let \(P(x,y)\) be the predicate \(x \lt y\text{.}\) It is true, in the natural numbers, that for all \(x\) there is some \(y\) greater than it (since there are infinitely many numbers). However, there is not a natural number \(y\) which is greater than every number \(x\text{.}\) Thus it is possible for \(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\) to be true while \(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\) is false.</p>
<p>We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some \(y\) for which every \(x\) satisfies \(P(x,y)\text{,}\) then certainly for every \(x\) there is some \(y\) which satisfies \(P(x,y)\text{.}\) The first is saying we can find one \(y\) that works for every \(x\text{.}\) The second allows different \(y\)'s to work for different \(x\)'s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same \(y\) that work for every \(x\text{.}\) In other words, while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction rule:</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;"><div class="sbspanel fixed-width" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><table>
<tr>
<td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0 lines"></td>
<td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0 lines">\(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0 lines">\(\therefore\)</td>
<td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0 lines">\(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\)</td>
</tr>
</table></div></div></div>
<p>Put yet another way, this says that the single statement</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\exists y \forall x P(x,y) \imp \forall x \exists y P(x,y)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>is always true. This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve that term for necessary truths in propositional logic. A statement in predicate logic that is necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a <dfn class="terminology">law of logic</dfn>  (or sometimes <dfn class="terminology">logically valid</dfn>,  but that is less fun).</p>
