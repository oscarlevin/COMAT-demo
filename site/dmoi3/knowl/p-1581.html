<p>We say \(P(n,k)\) counts <em class="emphasis">permutations</em>, and \({n \choose k}\) counts <em class="emphasis">combinations</em>.  The formulas for each are very similar, there is just an extra \(k!\) in the denominator of \({n \choose k}\text{.}\) That extra \(k!\) accounts for the fact that \({n \choose k}\) does not distinguish between the different orders that the \(k\) objects can appear in. We are just selecting (or choosing) the \(k\) objects, not arranging them. Perhaps “combination” is a misleading label. We don't mean it like a combination lock (where the order would definitely matter). Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors — you just need to decide which flavors to combine, not the order in which to combine them.</p>
