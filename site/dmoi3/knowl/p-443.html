<p>For us, a <dfn class="terminology">set</dfn>  will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played <em class="emphasis">The Doctor</em> on <em class="emphasis">Doctor Who</em>,  or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is a element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also, the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements. For example, the set containing all of the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as the set of vowels in the word “questionably” (namely, all of them); we do not care about order or repetitions, just whether the element is in the set or not.</p>
